## Codebase Walkthrough

Some insight into my codebase, I have done many iterations on my portfolio. What I first thought would take a month or two turned into a passion project. Constantly improving and incorporating new methods, better naming conventions (one of the most challenging parts of being a developer) and even adding insightful comments.

Database:
I decided to create a database folder that would hold and store all of my files, which includes ever growing techstack and project cards that I imported and then map over to display.
