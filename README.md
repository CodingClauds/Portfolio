## Codebase Walkthrough

Some insight into my codebase, I have done many iterations on my fully responsive site (portfolio). What I first thought would take a month or two turned into a passion project. Constantly improving and incorporating new methods, better naming conventions (one of the most challenging parts of being a developer) and even adding insightful comments.

Database:
I decided to create a database folder that would hold and store all of my files, which includes ever growing techstack and project cards that I imported and then map over to display.

Functionality:
Utilzied a library (Scroll Animation Library; AOS - Link above ðŸ†™) for my animations to fade in and out, as the user scrolls down the page. It is infinite, so it does reset when the user moves out of view.

Projects:
Here are a few projects I have worked on, currently looking to come back to some of these and do some codebase organization as needed.
